version 1.0.2

--increased action count
    -added reg pointer movements
    -cloned r0 operations to new pointers
    -added 'repeat_next' action
    -added loops: these cause an almost impossible increase in
        the time for a network to find an optimal solution.
    -added break, continue actions
    -added return value action for future functionality

--changed register pointers to be added during runtime:
    -can be modified before the program runs '/src/model/model.js' -> KEYS
    -future solution will modify through code during runtime

--added '/src/model/profile.js'
    -to show the time delta of resetting object properties vs creating new objects

--added fun property to models
    -will store list of functions
    -functions and/or loops might kill it all, if so will back off loops first
